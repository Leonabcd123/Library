# Book Management System

This C++ program is a simple yet functional book management system that allows users to manage their personal library. It supports adding, deleting, searching, and viewing books. All data is persistently stored in a text file (`books.txt`), with each book record including the name, author, and publication year.

## Features

- **View Books**: Lists all the books stored in the `books.txt` file, displaying their details.
- **Add a Book**: Enables the user to add a new book by providing its name, author, and publication year.
- **Delete a Book**: Allows the user to remove a book by specifying its name.
- **Search for a Book**: Searches for a book by name and displays its details if found.
- **File-based Storage**: All book data is saved to and retrieved from a text file, ensuring persistence across sessions.
