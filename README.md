# Book Management System

This C++ program provides a simple book management system that allows users to add, delete, search, and view books. It stores the books in a text file (`books.txt`), and each book contains the name, author, and publication year.

## Features

- **Show Books**: Displays all the books stored in the `books.txt` file.
- **Add Book**: Allows the user to add a new book to the file.
- **Delete Book**: Allows the user to delete a book by its name.
- **Search Book**: Allows the user to search for a book by name and display its details.
- **File Handling**: Books are stored in a text file, and operations like add, delete, and search are performed by reading and modifying the file.
